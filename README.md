Hello there üê∏,

Welcome to my profile. I'm weld, a computational physics graduate student in France. Back in the day, I worked as a software developer before starting a degree in physics. I was tired of implementing fields all day long. The meaning of "fields" has evolved since then, replacing dirty text inputs with abstract mathematical constructions. I'm all happy with it.

Nonetheless, I kept some proficiency in technologies, including low-level computing, optimization, databases, and so on. I'm totally inclined to use my knowledge to leverage scientific software by applying the high-quality standards I gained from the industry, such as test automation, ... And I‚Äôm actively looking for opportunities in high-performance computing. 

At the moment, my GitHub is quite poor in projects. I still maintain a software called "simd-ddm" to perform differential dynamic microscopy in no time using Intel intrinsics, vectorization, threading, ...

Feel free to contact me, I'm always interested in side projects!
